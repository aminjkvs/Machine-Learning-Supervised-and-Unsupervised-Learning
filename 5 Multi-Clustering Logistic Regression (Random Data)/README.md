# Multiclass Logistic Regression from Scratch  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
This implementation solves multi-class classification problems by:  
- Extending binary logistic regression to multiple classes using softmax  
- Finding optimal decision boundaries between multiple classes  
- Handling class probabilities through normalized exponential function  

## ðŸ›  Solution Approach  
Key features include:  
- Softmax activation for multi-class probability estimation  
- Gradient descent optimization  
- Categorical cross-entropy loss minimization  
- Dynamic visualization of:  
  - Evolving decision boundaries  
  - Training loss reduction  
- Automated GIF generation of training process
