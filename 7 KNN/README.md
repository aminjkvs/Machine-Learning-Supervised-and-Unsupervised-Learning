# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) from Scratch  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm for:  
- Classification and regression tasks  
- Instance-based learning (no explicit model training)  
- Capturing complex decision boundaries without assumptions about data distribution  

## ðŸ›  Solution Approach  
This implementation demonstrates:  
- Euclidean distance calculation  
- Majority voting for classification  
- Dynamic visualization of:  
  - Training data points  
  - Test point classification  
  - K-nearest neighbors identification  
- Automated GIF generation of classification process
