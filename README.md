# Machine-Learning-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Learning

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms, covering both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning approaches. Each implementation includes:
- Clean, modular Python code
- Mathematical formulation of the algorithm
- Training visualization (GIF/video)
- Parameter tuning guidance
