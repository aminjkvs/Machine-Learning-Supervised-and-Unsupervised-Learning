# Polynomial Regression from Scratch  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Polynomial regression addresses the limitation of linear regression by:  
- Modeling non-linear relationships between variables  
- Fitting polynomial curves to data points  
- Maintaining the benefits of linear regression while handling more complex patterns  

## ðŸ›  Solution Approach  
This implementation demonstrates:  
- Feature transformation into polynomial terms  
- Gradient descent optimization  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) minimization  
- Dynamic visualization of:  
  - Polynomial curve fitting  
  - Training loss reduction  
- Automated GIF generation of training process
