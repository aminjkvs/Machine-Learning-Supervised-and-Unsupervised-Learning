Here’s a well-structured README.md template for your K-Means clustering project, including explanations, algorithm details, and a GIF representation section:

# K-Means Clustering Implementation

## Problem Statement
Clustering geographical coordinates (latitude/longitude) from GPS data to identify natural groupings in the dataset. This helps in:
- Identifying hotspots or dense areas
- Understanding spatial patterns
- Segmenting geographical regions
- Optimizing location-based services

## Solution Approach
We implemented K-Means clustering to:
1. Process and normalize GPS coordinates
2. Automatically group similar locations
3. Visualize the clustering process through animation
4. Identify centroid locations representing cluster centers

## Algorithm Details: K-Means
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.

### Key Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Randomly select k data points as initial centroids
2. **Assignment**: Assign each data point to the nearest centroid
3. **Update**: Recalculate centroids as mean of all points in the cluster
4. **Repeat**: Until centroids stabilize or max iterations reached

### Mathematical Formulation:
- **Distance Metric**: Euclidean Distance  
  `d(x,y) = √Σ(xᵢ - yᵢ)²`
- **Objective Function**: Minimize within-cluster variance  
  `argmin Σ Σ ||x - μᵢ||²`  
  where μᵢ is the mean of points in cluster Sᵢ

### Implementation Features:
- Data normalization (Min-Max scaling)
- Dynamic visualization of clustering process
- GIF generation of algorithm convergence
- Handling of empty clusters
