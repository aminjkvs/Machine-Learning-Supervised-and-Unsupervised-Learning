# Lasso Regression Implementation  

## Problem Description  
Lasso regression solves two key problems in linear modeling:  
1. **Overfitting prevention** through L1 regularization  
2. **Automatic feature selection** by driving irrelevant feature weights to zero  

## Solution Approach  
This implementation demonstrates:  
- Proximal gradient descent with soft-thresholding  
- Combined MSE loss and L1 penalty optimization  
- Dynamic visualization of both:  
  - Regression line fitting  
  - Weight shrinkage process
