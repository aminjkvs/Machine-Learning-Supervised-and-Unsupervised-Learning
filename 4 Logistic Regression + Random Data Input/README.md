# Logistic Regression from Scratch  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Logistic regression addresses binary classification problems by:  
- Modeling the probability that an input belongs to a particular class  
- Finding an optimal decision boundary to separate classes  
- Handling non-linear relationships through the sigmoid function  

## ðŸ›  Solution Approach  
This implementation demonstrates:  
- Gradient descent optimization  
- Binary cross-entropy (log loss) minimization  
- Dynamic visualization of:  
  - Decision boundary evolution  
  - Training loss reduction  
- Automated GIF generation of the training process
